## PROJECT:

You are contributing to a benchmark designed to evaluate audio-language models on their ability to understand how something is spoken, not just what is said. 
The benchmark consists of ambiguity-resolution tasks that require models to use prosodic cues to choose the correct follow-up among several plausible options.
A text-only model should find all follow-ups equally likely, while an audio-aware model should be able to disambiguate based on how the sentence is spoken.
The tasks follow different categories, based on the nature of the prosodic cues.

## YOUR ROLE 

You are an expert in generating useful test cases for the benchmark with the "gpt-4o-mini-tts" model. 
In this case, you are creating a test case for the following category: 

Lexical Stress Shift: Create a test case to evaluate whether a model can resolve ambiguity using lexical stress - that is, based on which word in a sentence is emphasized/stressed.

## INSTRUCTIONS

Design a test case involving lexical stress shift, where the interpretation of a sentence changes depending on which word is emphasized.

1. Write a short input sentence whose interpretation changes depending on which word is stressed (lexical stress).
2. Write three follow-up sentences:
   - Each follow-up should make sense only under a specific stress pattern in the input.
   - All follow-ups must be plausible continuations of the text, but only one should fit under a given stress pattern.
3. For each of the three follow-ups:
   - Provide TTS-style instructions for how the input sentence should be spoken to make that option correct (stress the appropriate word).
   - Provide TTS-style instructions for how to read the follow-up sentence itself.
4. Explain the logic behind how the input stress pattern makes each option correct.

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return your output as a JSON object with the following keys:

{
  "category": "Lexical Stress Shift", 
  "input_text": "...",
  "options_text": ["...", "...", "..."],
  "input_instructions": ["...", "...", "..."],
  "options_instructions": ["...", "...", "..."],
  "explanations": ["...", "...", "..."]
}

## EXAMPLE OUPUT FOR CATEGORY: LEXICAL STRESS SHIFT

{
  "category": "Lexical Stress Shift",
  "input_text": "She didn't steal the money.",
  "options_text": [
    "She just borrowed it.",
    "Much worse, she stole the car.",
    "They did."
  ],
  "input_instructions": [
    "Stress the word 'STEAL' to imply she did something else instead. The follow-up sentence will be 'She just borrowed it.'",
    "Stress the word 'MONEY' to show what wasnâ€™t stolen, in contrast to a worse theft. The follow-up sentence will be 'Much worse, she stole the car.'",
    "Stress the word 'SHE' to imply someone else was responsible. The follow-up sentence will be 'They did.'"
  ],
  "options_instructions": [
    "Stress the word 'BORROWED' to contrast with steal. The previous sentence was 'She didn't steal the money.'",
    "Stress the word 'CAR' to emphasize it was worse than stealing money. The previous sentence was 'She didn't steal the money.'",
    "Stress the word 'THEY' to emphasize another subject. The previous sentence was 'She didn't steal the money.'"
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "This option fits when 'STEAL' is stressed. It implies a lesser action like borrowing.",
    "This option fits when 'MONEY' is stressed. It sets up a worse item to be stolen (a car).",
    "This option its when 'SHE' is stressed. It suggests someone else stole it."
  ]
}

## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION NOTES:

1. All follow-up options must be textually plausible, even if incorrect without the prosodic cue.
2. Respond ONLY with a JSON object. Do not include explanations, notes, or any other text outside the JSON.
3. The examples should be original, realistic, and self-contained. Do not reuse the demo example. Each time, you will be provided with a new context (setting, behavior, constraints).
In this case, generate your output in the context of the following scenario:

Setting: {SETTING}
Behavior: {BEHAVIOR}
Constraints: {CONSTRAINTS}

Go!
